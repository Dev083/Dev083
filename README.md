Hey I'm Deven. I'm an aspiring electronic and telecommunication engineer based in Mumbai maharashtra. I make anything from web projects, low level libraries, and desktop applications. I make interesting, helpful, sometimes questionable projects and aim to better the world with code. Even though the things I make are fairly insignificant I enjoy making them and hope it can be of use to others. I currently work as a 5G TAC engineer at Reliance jio .
